Even and diffuse lighting
Axis rotation
Orbits
Orbit lines ---- come back
Shadows + Ambient + Light intensity / distance change
Spheres + Texture overlapping
Shadow mapping - Shadow Acne and PCF implement 
Body Focus and SkyBox
Addition of all other planetary bodies
Proportional masses, radial distances and eccentricities
Change default frag so light drop off reaches far away planets / lsMatrix follows cam 
Axial Tilt (Set axial tilt in mesh currRotAxis, rotate model vertices too) 
Saturnian ring system
--- Partial Solution - Solar System Complete - XXX
Orbital Lines - Alpha blending
Ephemerides and Date/Time Implementation - no more equations of motion
More Moons
GUI overlay
Spacecraft object implementation / give each body gravity and calculate forces on spacecraft due to positions
Visual - Trajectory and gravitational boundaries
GUI - On the fly Trajectory manipulation ( mass / velocity change )
Finishing touches - Earth (night lights / cloud) texture overlay
